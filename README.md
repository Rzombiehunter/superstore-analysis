 Business Questions
Which products have the highest sales and profit?

Which regions generate the most sales and profit?

How do sales trends vary over time?

 Key Findings
1.  Top Products by Sales and Profit
Best-Selling Products: Tables, Phones, and Chairs led in total sales.

Most Profitable Products: Copiers generated the highest profit by far, despite lower sales volume.

Insight: High sales volume does not always equal high profit. Some best-sellers have low margins, while high-margin items like copiers are sold less frequently but drive strong profits.

2.  Regional Performance
West was the top-performing region in both sales and profit, making it the companyâ€™s strongest market.

East followed closely behind, showing consistent performance.

South had moderate sales but significantly lower profit.

Central region underperformed in both metrics, with signs of negative profit.

Insight: The West and East regions are profitable growth markets, while Central may require operational review or strategic rethinking.

3.  Sales Trends Over Time
Monthly sales data shows seasonal peaks and a general upward trend in revenue.

Certain months (like November and December) display sharp increases in sales, likely due to holiday shopping periods.

Insight: Recognizing peak seasons can help with inventory planning, marketing, and staffing.

 Business Implications
Prioritize investment in high-profit products and regions (e.g., copiers in the West).

Audit underperforming regions (especially Central) to identify logistical, marketing, or customer experience issues.

Use seasonality to optimize campaigns and inventory for high-sales periods.
